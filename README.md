# first-repo
This is my first addition to my github repository.

In this project I've used python, Tkinter, selenium and DBMS concepts.

I've made this project as a fun assignment to myself; I've tried implementing my python knowledge into this project.
The project is very useful for students who are lazy at coding and should not be misused.
